<h2>Lexer Notes</h2>

The lexer (<code>llex.lua</code>) is a version of the native 5.1.x lexer from
Yueliang 0.4.0, with significant modifications. It does have several
limitations:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The decimal point must be &apos;.&apos; (period). There is no localized decimal point replacement magic.
<li>There is no support for nested <code>[[</code>...<code>]]</code> long strings. (No <code>LUA_COMPAT_LSTR</code>.)
<li>The lexer may not properly lex source code with characters beyond the normal ASCII character set. Identifiers with accented characters (or any character beyond a byte value of 127) cannot be recognized.
</ul>

Instead of returning one token on each call, <code>llex.lua</code> processes an
entire string (all data from an entire file) and returns. Two lists
(tokens and semantic information items) are set up in the module for use
by the caller.
<p>
For maximum flexibility during processing, the lexer returns non-grammar
lexical elements as tokens too. Non-grammar elements, such as comments,
whitespace, line endings, are classified along with &apos;normal&apos; tokens. The
lexer classifies 7 kinds of grammar tokens and 4 kinds of non-grammar
tokens, as follows:

<h2>Lexer Optimizations</h2>

We aim to keep lexer-based optimizations free of parser considerations,
i.e. we allow for generalized optimization of token sequences. The table
below considers the requirements for all combinations of significant
tokens (except <code>TK_EOS</code>). Other tokens are whitespace-like. Comments
can be considered to be a special kind of whitespace, e.g. a short
comment needs to have a following EOL token, if we do not want to
optimize away short comments.

A dash (&apos;-&apos;) in the above means that the first token can abut the second
token.
<p>
<dl>
<dt><dd><code><strong>[S]</strong></code> Need at least one whitespace, set as either a space or kept as an EOL.
</dl>

<dl>
<dt><dd><code><strong>[1]</strong></code> Need a space if operator is a &apos;.&apos;, all others okay. A &apos;+&apos; or &apos;-&apos; is used as part of a floating-point spec, but there does not appear to be any way of creating a float by joining with number with a a &apos;+&apos; or &apos;-&apos; plus another number. Since an &apos;e&apos; has to be somewhere in the first token, this can&apos;t be done.
</dl>

<dl>
<dt><dd><code><strong>[2]</strong></code> Normally there cannot be consecutive operators, but we plan to allow for generalized optimization of token sequences, i.e. even sequences that are grammatically illegal; so disallow adjacent operators if:
<ul>
<li>the first is in [=&lt;&gt;] and the second is &apos;=&apos;
<li>disallow dot sequences to be adjacent, but &quot;...&quot; first okay
<li>disallow &apos;[&apos; followed by &apos;=&apos; or &apos;[&apos; (not optimal)
</ul>
</dl>

Also, a minus &apos;-&apos; cannot preceed a Comment or LComment, because comments
start with a &apos;--&apos; prefix. Apart from that, all Comment or LComment
tokens can be set abut with a real token.

<h2>Local Variable Renaming</h2>

<p>
The following discusses the problem of local variable optimization,
specifically <em>local variable renaming</em> in order to reduce source code
size.
<p>
<h3><code>TK_NAME</code> Token Considerations</h3>

A <code>TK_NAME</code> token means a number of things, and some of these cannot
be renamed without analyzing the source code. We are interested in the
use of <code>TK_NAME</code> in the following:
<p>
<dl>
<dt><dd>(a) global variable access
<dt><dd>(b) local variable declaration, including <code>local</code> statements, <code>local</code> functions, function parameters, implicit &quot;<code>self</code>&quot; locals
<dt><dd>(c) local variable access, including upvalue access
</dl>

<code>TK_NAME</code> is also used in parts of the grammar as constant strings --
these tokens cannot be optimized without user assistance. These include
usage as:
<p>
<dl>
<dt><dd>(d) keys in <code>key=value</code> pairs in table construction
<dt><dd>(e) field or method names in <code>a:b</code> or <code>a.b</code> syntax forms
</dl>

For the local variable name optimization scheme used, we do not consider
(d) and (e), and while global variables cannot be renamed without some
kind of user assistance, they need to be considered or tracked as part
of Lua&apos;s variable access scheme.
<p>
<h3>Lifetime of a Local Variable</h3>

Consider the following example:
<p>
<dl>
<dt><dd><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">local</span> string, table = string, table
</pre></dl>

<p>
In the example, the two locals are assigned the values of the globals
with the same names. When Lua encounters the declaration portion:
<p>
<dl>
<dt><dd><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">local</span> string, table
</pre></dl>

<p>
the parser cannot immediately make the two local variable available to
following code. In the parser and code generator, locals are inactive
when entries are created. They are activated only when the function
<code>adjustlocalvars()</code> is called to activate the appropriate local
variables. (Note that the terminology used here may not be identical to
the ones used in the Dragon Book -- they merely follow the LuaSrcDiet
code as it was written before I have read the Dragon Book.)
<p>
In the example, the two local variables are activated only after the
whole statement has been parsed, that is, after the last &quot;<code>table</code>&quot;
token. Hence, the statement works as expected. Also, once the two local
variables goes out of scope, <code>removevars()</code> is called to deactivate
them, allowing other variables of the same name to become visible again.
<p>
Another example worth mentioning is:
<p>
<dl>
<dt><dd><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">local</span> a, a, a, = <span class="number">1</span>, <span class="number">2</span>, <span class="number">3</span>
</pre></dl>

<p>
The above will assign 3 to &apos;a&apos;.
<p>
Thus, when optimizing local variable names, (1) we need to consider
accesses of global variable names affecting the namespace, (2) for the
local variable names themselves, we need to consider when they are
declared, activated and removed, and (3) within the &apos;live&apos; time of
locals, we need to know when they are accessed (since locals that are
never accessed don&apos;t really matter.)
<p>
<h3>Local Variable Tracking</h3>

Every local variable declaration is considered an object to be renamed.
<p>
From the parser, we have the original name of the local variable, the
token positions for declaration, activation and removal, and the token
position for all the <code>TK_NAME</code> tokens which references this local. All
instances of the implicit &quot;<code>self</code>&quot; local variable are also flagged as
such.
<p>
In addition to local variable information, all global variable accesses
are tabled, one object entry for one name, and each object has a
corresponding list of token positions for the <code>TK_NAME</code> tokens, which
is where the global variables were accessed.
<p>
The key criteria is: <strong>Our act of renaming cannot change the visibility
of any of these locals and globals at the time they are accessed</strong>.
However, <em>their scope of visibility may be changed during which they
are not accessed</em>, so someone who tries to insert a variable reference
somewhere into a program that has its locals renamed may find that it
now refers to a different variable.
<p>
Of course, if every variable has a unique name, then there is no need
for a name allocation algorithm, as there will be no conflict. But, in
order to maximize utilization of short identifier names to reduce the
final code size, we want to reuse the names as much as possible. In
addition, fewer names will likely reduce symbol entropy and may slightly
improve compressibility of the source code. LuaSrcDiet avoids the use of
non-ASCII letters, so there are only 53 single-character variable names.
<p>
<h3>Name Allocation Theory</h3>

To understand the renaming algorithm, first we need to establish how
different local and global variables can operate happily without
interfering with each other.
<p>
Consider three objects, local object A, local object B and global object
G. A and B involve declaration, activation and removal, and within the
period it is active, there may be zero or more accesses of the local.
For G, there are only global variable accesses to look into.
<p>
Assume that we have assigned a new name to A and we wish to consider its
effects on other locals and globals, for which we choose B and G as
examples. We assume local B has not been assigned a new name as we
expect our algorithm to take care of collisions.
<p>
A&apos;s lifetime is something like this:
<p>
<pre>
        Decl            Act                             Rem
        +               +-------------------------------+
        -------------------------------------------------
</pre>
<p>
where &apos;Decl&apos; is the time of declaration, &apos;Act&apos; is the time of
activation, and &apos;Rem&apos; is the time of removal. Between &apos;Act&apos; and &apos;Rem&apos;,
the local is alive or &apos;live&apos; and Lua can see it if its corresponding
<code>TK_NAME</code> identifier comes up.
<p>
<pre>
        Decl            Act                             Rem
        +               +-------------------------------+
        -------------------------------------------------
   *            *             *                              *
  (1)          (2)           (3)                            (4)
</pre>
<p>
Recall that the key criteria is to not change the visibility of globals
and locals during when they are accessed. Consider local and global
accesses at (1), (2), (3) and (4).
<p>
A global G of the same name as A will only collide at (3), where Lua
will see A and not G. Since G must be accessed at (3) according to what
the parser says, and we cannot modify the positions of &apos;Decl&apos;, &apos;Act&apos; and
&apos;Rem&apos;, it follows that A cannot have the same name as G.
<p>
<pre>
                Decl    Act                     Rem
                +       +-----------------------+
                ---------------------------------
 (1)+   +---+   (2)+   +---+      (3)+   +---+	    (4)+   +---+
    ---------      ---------         ---------         ---------
</pre>
<p>
For the case of A and B having the same names and colliding, consider
the cases for which B is at (1), (2), (3) or (4) in the above.
<p>
(1) and (4) means that A and B are completely isolated from each other,
hence in the two cases, A and B can safely use the same variable names.
To be specific, since we have assigned A, B is considered completely
isolated from A if B&apos;s activation-to-removal period is isolated from
the time of A&apos;s first access to last access, meaning B&apos;s active time
will never affect any of A&apos;s accesses.
<p>
For (2) and (3), we have two cases where we need to consider which one
has been activated first. For (2), B is active before A, so A cannot
impose on B. But A&apos;s accesses are valid while B is active, since A can
override B. For no collision in the case of (2), we simply need to
ensure that the last access of B occurs before A is activated.
<p>
For (3), B is activated before A, hence B can override A&apos;s accesses. For
no collision, all of A&apos;s accesses cannot happen while B is active. Thus
position (3) follows the &quot;A is never accessed when B is active&quot; rule in
a general way. Local variables of a child function are in the position
of (3). To illustrate, the local B can use the same name as local A and
live in a child function or block scope if each time A is accessed, Lua
sees A and not B. So we have to check all accesses of A and see whether
they collide with the active period of B. If A is not accessed during
that period, then B can be active with the same name.
<p>
The above appears to resolve all sorts of cases where the active times
of A and B overlap. Note that in the above, the allocator does not need
to know how locals are separated according to function prototypes.
Perhaps the allocator can be simplified if knowledge of function
structure is utilized. This scheme was implemented in a hurry in 2008 --
it could probably be simpler if Lua grammar is considered, but
LuaSrcDiet mainly processes various index values in tables.
<p>
<h3>Name Allocation Algorithm</h3>

To begin with, the name generator is mostly separate from the name
allocation algorithm. The name generator returns the next shortest name
for the algorithm to apply to local variables. To attempt to reduce
symbol entropy (which benefit compression algorithms), the name
generator follows English frequent letter usage. There is also an option
to calculate an actual symbol entropy table from the input data.
<p>
Since there are 53 one-character identifiers and (53*63-4) two-character
identifiers (minus a few keywords), there isn&apos;t a pressing need to
optimally maximize name reuse. The single-file version of LuaSrcDiet
0.12.0, at just over 3000 SLOC and 156KB in size, currently allocates
around 55 unique local variable names.
<p>
In theory, we should need no more than 260 local identifiers by default.
Why? Since <code>LUAI_MAXVARS</code> is 200 and <code>LUAI_MAXUPVALUES</code> is 60, at
any block scope, there can be at most <code>(LUAI_MAXVARS +
LUAI_MAXUPVALUES)</code> locals referenced, or 260. Also, those from outer
scopes not referenced in inner scopes can reuse identifiers. The net
effect of this is that a local variable name allocation method should
not allocate more than 260 identifier names for locals.
<p>
The current algorithm is a simple first-come first-served scheme:
<p>
<dl>
<dt><dd>(a) One local object that use the most tokens is named first.
<dt><dd>(b) Any other non-conflicting locals with respect to the first object are assigned the same name.
<dt><dd>(c) Assigned locals are removed from consideration and the procedure is repeated for objects that have not been assigned new names.
<dt><dd>(d) Steps (a) to (c) repeats until no local objects are left.
</dl>

In addition, there are a few extra issues to take care of:
<p>
<dl>
<dt><dd>(e) Implicit &quot;<code>self</code>&quot; locals that have been flagged as such are already &quot;assigned to&quot; and so they are left unmodified.
<dt><dd>(f) The name generator skips &quot;<code>self</code>&quot; to avoid conflicts. This is not optimal but it is unlikely a script will use so many local variables as to reach &quot;<code>self</code>&quot;.
<dt><dd>(g) Keywords are also skipped for the name generator.
<dt><dd>(h) Global name conflict resolution.
</dl>

For (h), global name conflict resolution is handled just after the new
name is generated. The name can still be used for some locals even if it
conflicts with other locals. To remove conflicts, global variable
accesses for the particular identifier name is checked. Any local
variables that are active when a global access is made is marked to be
skipped. The rest of the local objects can then use that name.
<p>
The algorithm has additional code for handling locals that use the same
name in the same scope. This extends the basic algorithm that was
discussed earlier. For example:
<p>
<dl>
<dt><dd><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">local</span> foo = <span class="number">10</span> <span class="comment">-- (1)</span>
...
<span class="keyword">local</span> foo = <span class="number">20</span> <span class="comment">-- (2)</span>
...
print(e)
</pre></dl>

<p>
Since we are considering name visibility, the first &apos;<code>foo</code>&apos; does not
really cease to exist when the second &apos;<code>foo</code>&apos; is declared, because if
we were to make that assumption, and the first &apos;<code>foo</code>&apos; is removed
before (2), then I should be able to use &apos;<code>e</code>&apos; as the name for the
first &apos;<code>foo</code>&apos; and after (2), it should not conflict with variables in
the outer scope with the same name. To illustrate:
<p>
<dl>
<dt><dd><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">local</span> e = <span class="number">10</span> <span class="comment">-- &apos;foo &apos; renamed to &apos;e&apos;</span>
...
<span class="keyword">local</span> t = <span class="number">20</span> <span class="comment">-- error if we assumed &apos;e&apos; removed here</span>
...
print(e)
</pre></dl>

<p>
Since &apos;<code>e</code>&apos; is a global in the example, we now have an error as the
name as been taken over by a local. Thus, the first &apos;<code>foo</code>&apos; local must
have its active time extend to the end of the current scope. If there is
no conflict between the first and second &apos;<code>foo</code>&apos;, the algorithm may
still assign the same names to them.
<p>
The current fix to deal with the above chains local objects in order to
find the removal position. It may be possible to handle this in a clean
manner -- LuaSrcDiet handles it as a fix to the basic algorithm.

<h2>Ideas</h2>

The following is a list of optimization ideas that do not require
heavy-duty source code parsing and comprehension.
<p>
<h3>Lexer-Based Optimization Ideas</h3>

<ul>
<li>Convert long strings to normal strings, vice versa.
</ul>
<dl>
<dt><dd><em>A little desperate for a few bytes, can be done, but not real keen on implementing it.</em>
</dl>

<ul>
<li>Special number forms to take advantage of constant number folding.
</ul>
<dl>
<dt><dd><em>For example, 65536 can be represented using 2^16, and so on. An expression must be evaluated in the same way, otherwise this seems unsafe.</em>
</dl>

<ul>
<li>Warn if a number has too many digits.
</ul>
<dl>
<dt><dd><em>Should we warn or &quot;test and truncate&quot;? Not really an optimization that will see much use.</em>
</dl>

<ul>
<li>Warn of opportunity for using a <code>local</code> to zap a bunch of globals.
</ul>
<dl>
<dt><dd><em>Current recommendation is to use the HTML plugin to display globals in red. The developer can then visually analyze the source code and make the appropriate fixes. I think this is better than having the program guess the intentions of the developer.</em>
</dl>

<ul>
<li>Spaces to tabs in comments, long comments, or long strings.
</ul>
<dl>
<dt><dd><em>For long strings, need to know user&apos;s intention. Would rather not implement.</em>
</dl>

<h3>Parser-Based Optimization Ideas</h3>

Heavy-duty optimizations will need more data to be generated by the
parser. A full AST may eventually be needed. The most attractive idea
that can be quickly implemented with a significant code size &apos;win&apos; is to
reduce the number of <code>local</code> keywords.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Remove unused <code>local</code>s that can be removed in the source.
</ul>
<dl>
<dt><dd><em>Need to consider unused <code>local</code>s in multiple assignments.</em>
</dl>

<ul>
<li>Simplify declaration of <code>local</code>s that can be merged.
</ul>
<dl>
<dt><dd><em>From:</em>
</dl>
<dl>
<dl>
<dt><dd><pre class="code"><span class="comment">-- separate locals</span>
