	// Sublime Stonehearth Build System
	// Sublime Build Systems are invoked via the Tools -> Build option (or Ctrl+B).
	// This one can be used to automatically run Stonehearth.  To install:
	//
	//   1) Copy this file into your Sublime Packages/User directory.  For me
	//      on Windows 8.1, this is C:\Users\Ponder\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages\User
	//      YMMV.
	//   2) Change working_dir and PATH (below) to point to the correct dirs on your system
	//
	// Once installed, Stonehearth will automatically run when you press Ctrl+B when
	// a .lua file is currently selected.  To always run Stonehearth on Ctrl+B, goto
	// Tools -> Build System and manually select Run Stonehearth.
	//
	// For more information see:
	//   http://sublime-text-unofficial-documentation.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/build_systems.html
	//	
	// Sublime by default supresses all GUIs created by the build system.  To get
	// around this, run a python process (which gets its GUI supressed) to fork
	// this Stonehearth process.  Something in that process breaks relative paths,
	// so just rely on the PATH environment variable to find Stonehearth.exe
