   Gather all the materials necessary to craft the recipe.
   If the gathering is interrupted, all collected things
   stay on the workbench, but on resume, the worker evaluates
   a new recipe (and does not attempt to finish the recipe
   he was halfway through gathering).

   Pros: If we're interrupted halfway through gathering, and
   the remaining stuff needed is no longer in the world when
   we resume, we can just start a new recipe and reuse some
   of the gathered things.
   Cons: We may have gathered a bunch of things that are no longer
   useful, and that now only he can use.
