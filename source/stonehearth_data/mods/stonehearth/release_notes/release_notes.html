This release adds a few new featuers. We're working on optimizing the new AI code so the game will run smoother, but these improvements are ready now and we wanted to get them in your hands.

<h2>Change to Job Promotion Gameplay Flow</h2>
We've changed the way you promote the Carpenter. Instead of building workshops from the menu, you first promote the Carpenter from a saw, then the Carpenter builds his own workshop.
<p>
This way, 100% of classes get promoted in the same way, by grabbing their tool: the saw for the Carpenter, a sword for a Swordsman, etc. 

<h2>New World Map!</h2>
When you start a new game, you'll see an overview of the world and choose where you want to settle. As we add game features, we'll add more information to the map and the information scroll that describe your chosen starting spot.

<h2>Quick Start</h2>
We've added the option to start the game at a random location in a random world.
