In this release we focused primarily on fixing the "stuck worker" problem. We've made quite a bit of progress, but are still sanding off the rough edges. Here are the major changes in this update.

<h2>Stuck Workers Fixed</h2>
Workers getting stuck whild building, stocking, hauling, etc. has been nearly completely eradicated! Three cheers for the workers and their upgraded little brains!

<h2>Warning: Avoid Issuing Too Many Simultaneous Orders</h2>
A side-effect of fixing the stuck workers is that the workers "think" quite a bit more. If you issue too many simultaneous orders, all this thinking can slow the game down. 
<p>
This will be fixed in a future patch, but for now please be aware of the issue. You'll know that your game is "overthinking" if the debug bar in the lower right is mostly or entirely blue. The work-around is to just wait for your current harvest and build commands are complete before issuing new ones.

<h2>Better Error Reporting</h2>
To aid in our debugging, the UI will now show errors that pop up anywhere in the system. If a huge error window pops up during your play session, don't be alarmed. For some errors you can just close the window and keep playing. For more severe errors, you may just be hosed and need to restart your game.
<p>
If you can consistently reproduce an error, please sumit a screenshot to the beta forum and tell us how to reproduce the bug.
