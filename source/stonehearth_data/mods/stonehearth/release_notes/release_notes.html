Welcome to the unstable release of Stonehearth Alpha 4! More complete patch notes will be forthcoming. For now, here are the major changes:

<h2>Introducing the Footman and Basic Combat!</h2>
Wooden Swords will now promote citizens to Swordsmen. It's also possible for your town to receive "visitors" interested in taking your stuff, so you'll need them. Combat right now is very rough, and will yet undergo EXTENSIVE tuning.


<h2>Building Designer, Phase 1</h2>
You can now design and build your own custom buildings. The tool is just in its beginning phases, and is a bit difficult to use right now. We know. It will get better!

<h2>New GUI</h2>
The GUI has received an extensive overhaul, with a centralized scoreboard and management screens for your citizens and crafters.

<h2>Caravan Notifications!</h2>
Every now and then, you will receive a notification that a caravan has swung by your settlement. Caravans can provide new settlers or offer to trade new things for existing or craftable goods. 

<h2>Bugs and Weirdness!</h2>
What would an unstable release be without instability? Some bugs we know about: 
<ul>
   <li><strong>Unstable Save:</strong> Sometimes, the game is in a state that breaks the saving utility, crashing the UI. Preventive Fix: Save often. If you get a bad save, delete it from the saved games folder and reload an older save.</li>
   <li><strong>Gravity w/o Physics:</strong> Putting items on top of other items causes the top item to hover in the air instead of falling realistically to the ground. Fix: None, take hilarious screenshots and post them online.</li>
   <li><strong>Revamped Shortcut Keys:</strong> We're in the middle of overhauling this system. Pay close attention to the tooltips, and send us feedback.</li>
</ul>
