<h2>Introducing the Trapper!</h2>
The Trapper is a scouting and food producing class. We’re experimenting with the idea of directly controlling some units, so you can direct the trapper to scout the map and farm any critters that you run into. Let us know what you think!

<h2>Fog of War</h2>
Hey, everything is dark! Yep. You now have to explore the map to reveal it. Critters are hidden and will be exposed just outside your sight radius. Eventually, we will have three regions: visible, explored, and unexplored. For now, the visible region is the same as the explored region.

<h2>New AI Scheduler</h2>
Your lovable settlers have new thinking routines. This improves cooperation, adds stability to their tasks, and sometimes leads to charming behavior. It should also greatly improve performance and reduce the amount of stuttering that occurs in the game.
