Welcome to Stonehearth! Here are the patch notes for this build.

<h1>Latest</h1>
In order to fix some of the bugs in 2477, we have updated saves (so saves made in 2477 will no longer be playable). Once alpha 11 is more stable, we'll be able to keep the save games compatible for the alpha.

<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>If a crafter tries to craft a recipe when there isn't enough resources, the crafter will not automatically try to craft again if resources do become available in the future. Work around is to queue up any other task on the crafter's workbench.</li>
<li>Objects in hearthling backpacks will show up in place furniture screen even though they cannot be placed.</li>
<li>Objects that are in iconic form versus objects placed in the world will show up as separate items (but with the same icon/name/description) in town inventory screen.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Develop-2477</h1>
<h2>Embark!</h2>
When starting a new game, you can now see portraits and roll attributes for your hearthlings. (Mouse over the attributes to see a description.) You can also give your hearthlings new names and purchase inital starting equipment.

<h2>Crates</h2>
Carpenters can now craft crates to store and organize your items. Crates come in two sizes and function much like mobile stockpiles. This means you can move them to where they are needed. For example, you can load up a crate with wood and then move it near a construction site. Or, put a food crate in your dining hall!

<h2>Backpacks for all</h2>
All hearthlings are now equipped with a backpack that can hold up to four items. This makes them much more efficient at restocking items as well as other tasks. You can see the contents of their backpack on the character sheet.

<h2>Preview of the Cook</h2>
The cook profession has been enabled. There are only two recipes at the moment, but we will be adding many more later. Uncooked food now spoils after a few days, so don't overproduce it! Prepared food lasts longer but will also eventually spoil.

<h2>Attributes</h2>
Hearthling attributes now have more of an impact on the game. Over time, we'll continue to add more effects. An example of some of the effects currently in the game:
<ul>
<li>Diligence increases crafting speed.</li>
<li>Curiosity increases experience gain when crafting new items.</li>
<li>Inventiveness increases chance of crafting fine items.</li>
<li>Muscle increases weapon damage.</li>
<li>Stamina determines duration of hearthling sleep.</li>
<li>Courage determines change to flee in combat.</li>
<li>Compassion affects maximum number of trapper pets and improves sheep wool production and reproduction rates.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<li>Improved/fixed stuttering when you have a large number of items in the world.</li>
<li>Improved lua garbage collection behavior. This should help with memory issues on slower systems.</li>
<li>Increased rendering engine performance while reducing cpu usage.</li>

<h2>Other Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>You can now specify the seed used to generate the world so you can replay a map.</li>
<li>The fog of war has been lifted when selecting your starting location.</li>
<li>Portraits added to the unit info pane in the bottm left corner. Clicking on the portait brings up the character sheet.</li>

<li>Show armor and weapon bonuses on the character sheet.</li>
<li>Hearthlings can now pick up and place items on multiple levels instead of just at foot level.</li>
