Welcome to Stonehearth! Here are the major changes in this release.


<h2>Water, Part 1</h2>
<p>
Lakes now spawn in the world, and water behaves rationally as the terrain is deformed. There’s still a lot to do here: rivers, improvements to the simulation, swimming, and the ability to use water as a resource.
</p>

<h2>Building Improvements, Part 1</h2>
<p>
The building system has gone through a major upgrade. This is a work-in-progress. Expect bugs and unfinished features.
</p>
<ul>
<li>You can now create multi-story buildings using the slab, grow-walls, and grow-roof tools!   This is especially buggy at this stage of the Alpha, but feel free to try it out.</li>
<li>The road and building designers have been merged into a new GUI.</li>
<li>Hearthlings are smarter about building shapes created out of slabs.</li>
<li>Many more building patterns</li>
<li>Coming Soon: Voxel editing tools, proper roofs for multi-story buildings.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Combat Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Part 2 of the Goblin Campaign: Wolf Raiders! Send your hearthings to free the wolves from their cages before their trainer can turn them on you. </li>
<li>Goblin Camp boss and associated minions are now appropriately armed and buffed. </li>
<li>Wandering undead now spawn at night.</li>
</ul>

<h2>UI Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Building editor redesign. It’s now much easier to place and build buildings based on templates.</li>
<li>New menu GUI. Reorganized the menu options to make more sense. Some hotkeys have changed.</li>
<li>In the citizen UI. Clicking a row will not focus the camera on that Hearthling.</li>
<li>In the embark screen, show star ratings for vegetation, wildlife, and minerals.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Performance Improvements</h2>
<uL>
<li>AI: Stonehearth can now handle many more Hearthlings thinking and working at the same time.</li>
<li>Mining large regions and building long roads takes much less CPU time.</li>
<li>Reduced batch-counts for 3D rendering.</li>
</uL>
