Welcome to Stonehearth! Here are the major changes in this release.

<h2>64-bit Client!</h2>
<p>
We are now shipping both 64-bit and 32-bit versions of the game. If you're running a 64-bit OS, we
highly suggest using the 64-bit version. Choose your game version from the System tab of the Settings
screen.
</p>

<h2>New Harvesting Commands</h2>
The new commands are:
<ul>
  <li>Clear, to completely destroy unwanted items</li>
  <li>Cancel Orderm to undo previously issued harvest commands</li>
  <li>Loot, to steal items that belong to someone else. For now this means just the goblins</li>
</ul>

<h2>Combat Rebalance</h2>
<p>
Each individual goblin is now much more of a threat, but they will come at you in fewer numbers.
Also, there are now serveral different kinds of goblins, with different stats and behaviors.
</p>

<h2>Combat Scenarios</h2>
<p>
The goblins now organize themselves into structured raiding camps. You'll need
to find a way of dealing with them once they set up camp near your town.
</p>

<h2>Shops</h2>
Travelling merchants will visit your town every now and then. You can sell
your excess inventory for gold, and use that gold to buy from all merchants.
