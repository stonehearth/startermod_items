<h2>Introducing the Trapper!</h2>
The Trapper is a scouting and food producing class. Weâ€™re experimenting with the idea of directly controlling some units, so you can direct the trapper to scout the map and farm any critters that you run into. Let us know what you think!

Your lovable settlers have new thinking routines. This improves cooperation, adds stability to their tasks, and sometimes leads to charming behavior.

<h2>For of War</h2>
