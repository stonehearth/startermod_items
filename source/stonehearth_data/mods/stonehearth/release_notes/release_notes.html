Welcome to Stonehearth! Here are the major changes in this release.

<h2>Experimental 64-bit Client</h2>
<p>
If you're running a 64-bit OS, Stonehearth will now run in 64-bit mode!  This
should resolve the out-of-memory crash bugs.  We have more fixes for the 32-bit
build coming in Alpha 9 and Alpha 10.
</p>
<p>
The 64-bit support is highly experimental!  Please bear with us while we iron
out the remaning bugs.
</p>

<h2>Fix Save Overwrite Bug</h2>
The bug which would sometimes cause a save to be deleted when you try to
overwrite it has been squashed.  Hooray!!
