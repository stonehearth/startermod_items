Welcome to the unstable release of Stonehearth Alpha 4! More complete patch notes will be forthcoming. For now, here are the major changes.

<h2>Introducing the Footman and Basic Combat!</h2>
Wooden Swords will now promote citizens to Swordsmen. It's also possible for your town to receive "visitors" interested in taking your stuff, so you'll need them. Combat right now is very rough, and will undergoe EXTENSIVE tuning during the unstable phase of this alpha.


<h2>Building Designer, Phase 1</h2>
You can now design and build your own custom buildings. The tool is just in its beginning phases, and is a bit difficult to use right now. We know. It will get better!

<h2>New GUI</h2>
The GUI has received an extensive overhaul, with a centralized scoreboard and management screens for your citizens and crafters.
