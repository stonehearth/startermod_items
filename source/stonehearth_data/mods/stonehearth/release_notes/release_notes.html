Welcome to the unstable release of Stonehearth Alpha 4! More complete patch notes will be forthcoming. For now, here are the major changes:

<h2>New Classes: Footman, Weaver, and Trapper!</h2>
You can now upgrade your citizens to three new classes.
<ul>
   <li><strong>Footman</strong> Basic fighting unit, who will automatically patrol your town and defend you from invaders. Invaders?</li>
   <li><strong>Weaver</strong> A new crafter unit who crafts decorative items and basic armor for your units.</li>
   <li><strong>Trapper</strong> The trapper's back, with a less micro-intensive style of play!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Basic Combat!</h2>
After a while, you can expect your town to receive "visitors" interested in taking your stuff, so you'll need them. Combat right now is fairly rough, and will undergo EXTENSIVE tuning during the next few alphas.

<h2>Building Designer, Phase 1</h2>
You can now design and build your own custom buildings. The tool is just in its beginning phases, and is a bit difficult to use right now. We know. It will get better!

<h2>New GUI</h2>
The GUI has received an extensive overhaul, with a centralized scoreboard and management screens for your citizens and crafters.

<h2>Caravan Notifications!</h2>
Every now and then, you will receive a notification that a caravan has swung by your settlement. Caravans can provide new settlers or offer to trade new things for existing or craftable goods.
