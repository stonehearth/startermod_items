Use stonehearth:drop\_carrying\_now when an entity should drop whatever they are carrying immediately. 
Often, this is used before starting an action that requires the entity's hands to be empty. 

For example,  _Admire\_fire_, _death\_action_, _harvest\_plant_, and _combat\_action_ all start by calling: 
      ai:execute('stonehearth:drop\_carrying\_now')

You can call this action even when you are unsure whether the entity is carrying anything; in fact, use it as the first action in a sequence to make sure that the entity will go into subsequent states with nothing in their arms
If the drop animation is interrupted, the item will still get dropped. 

stonehearth:drop\_carrying\_now is only implemented by the drop\_carrying\_now\_action.lua file:
